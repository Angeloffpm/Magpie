## Start
1. Tell me more about your family.
2. Why so negative?
3. Do you really think so?
4. Why so negative?

## Exercises
1. Added Keywords
    "football" or "NFL" = "The Broncos are my favorite team."
    "school" = "Always go to school."
    "Bubby" = "I love Bubby."
2. Depends on the order of the if statements. "My mother has a dog but no cat." would trigger "Why so negative." because it contains "no" and that's the first if statement.

## Question
1. The if statement will still trigger because the String has the word, regardless of it being inside of another word like "no" in "know". It would thus return "Why so negative?" which is a problem because the user didn't mean to say "no."
