## Activity 1

Exploration - Zog Bot
1. I'm from a planet in the Andromeda System.
2. What electrical impulses are you currently having?
3. We HAD a family that we abducted, but they turned out to be crazy. So, just as a joke, we dropped them off in Washington, D.C. where I think they all have jobs in the government.
    - I asked if Zog had a family.
4. Pardon me?

Questions
1. Asking anything about Zog's face prompts "No, your face."
    Asking "Do you have [anything]" gives "Probably, but we can't tell for sure. Malkatron lost the inventory list."
2. "Do you have a face?" -> "No, your face."
    - Actually gave "Can't you see me?"
    "Do you have face?" -> "Probably, but..."
    - Worked
